			<p class="lead">In this four hour online workshop I'll take traders of any level and make them feel confident enough to begin start trading the stock market. So whether your background is in financial analysis, banking or portfolio management you will learn from this course.</p>


<h3>Solve the charts</h3>


<p>So many people, especially traders, jump head-first into their trades without a clear vision of what they want to accomplish. That's bad. Not only will you lose money, but you will end up not understanding the essence of making money in the stock market.</p>

<p>Instead your trades should be executed in a systematic manner, without emotion, and focused on the charts and the method. After all, you don't want to use the stock market as a casino.</p>

<h3>What you'll take home</h3>

<p>In addition to everything you learn 
in the course, there are few things 
for you to keep.</p>

<ul>
	<li>All the slides to refer back to 
	specific contents.</li>

	<li>A recording of the class so that you 
	can re-watch it later.</li>

	<li>A transcript of the chat room. Lots 
	of great questions and equally good 
	answers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When and where?</h3>

<p>This is a four hour long workshop 
held on March 30'th 2015, from 9:00 
AM to 1:00 PM Pacific Standard Time. 
That means you donâ€™t have to get on 
an airplane or deal with hotels, but 
you still get the same great content.</p>

<h3>Who is putting this on?</h3>

<p>Hey, I'm LJ Nissen, an investor and 
software developer from Stockholm,
Sweden. I care about systematic 
approaches to investing beit the 
Junior Mining Space or technical 
analysis. My first book, The Junior
Mining Valuation Handbook, will 
come out in the spring of 2015.</p>
